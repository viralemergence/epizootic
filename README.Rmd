`epizootic` is an extension to `poems`, a spatially-explicit, process-explicit, pattern-oriented framework for modeling population dynamics. This extension adds functionality for modeling disease dynamics in wildlife. It also adds capability for seasonality and for unique dispersal dynamics for each life cycle stage.

## Installation

You can install the development version of epizootic from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("viralemergence/epizootic")
```

## About R6 classes

`poems` and `epizootic` run on [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html) classes. R is primarily a *functional* programming language in which the primary units of programming are expressions and functions. Here we use R6 to create an *object-oriented* framework inside of R.
