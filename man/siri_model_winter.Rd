\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{inputs}{A nested list with named elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{replicates}}{Number of replicate simulation runs.}

combination of stages and compartment for which transmission applies (see
\code{transmission_mask} below.}
\item{\code{transmission_unit}}{A vector indicating whether mortality
rates are daily or seasonal. 1 indicates seasonal, 0 indicates daily.}

days for each population at time step.}

stage-compartment combo (rows) and population (columns) at time step.}

at (current) time step.}

dynamically accessible \emph{attached} and \emph{results} lists.}

}
\value{
An abundance matrix with \code{populations} columns and
\code{stages*compartments} rows, updated from the \code{segment_abundance} input in
\code{inputs} according to demography and disease dynamics.
}
\description{
Simulate a \emph{Mycoplasma gallisepticum} outbreak during the non-breeding season day-by-day in a
population of house finches (\emph{Haemorhous mexicanus}). Uses a SIRI model (Susceptible-Infected 1-
Recovered-Infected 2+) and includes demographic stochasticity in fecundity, mortality, and
infection.
}
\details{
The function can also handle the case in which there are no infected individuals. The principal
difference between this function and the one for simulating an outbreak in the breeding season
is that this one does not include fecundity.
