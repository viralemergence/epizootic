#' Simulate a *Mycoplasma gallisepticum* Outbreak in the Breeding Season
#'
#' Simulate a *Mycoplasma gallisepticum* outbreak during the breeding season
#' day-by-day in a population of house finches (*Haemorhous mexicanus*). Uses a
#' SIRI model (Susceptible-Infected 1- Recovered-Infected 2+) and includes
#' demographic stochasticity in fecundity, mortality, and infection.
#'
#' The function can also handle the case in which there are no infected
#' individuals. The principal difference between this function and the one for
#' simulating an outbreak in the non-breeding season is that this one includes
#' fecundity.
